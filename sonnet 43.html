        <h1>Sonnet 43: How Do I Love Thee?</h1>

            <p> 
               How do I love thee? let me count the ways.<br/>
               I love thee to the depth and breath and height<br/>
               My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br/>
               For the ends of being and ideal Grace.<br/>
               I love thee to the level of every day's<br/>
               Most quiet need , by sun and candle-light.<br/>
               I love thee freely, as a men strive for Right;<br/>
               I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.<br/>
               I love thee with the passion put to use<br/>
               In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.<br/>
               I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br/>
               With my lost saints,-I love thee with the<br/>
               breath,
               Smiles, tears, of all my life!-and, if God<br/>
               choose,<br/>
               I shall but the love thee better after death.<br/>

        <p><b>Explanation:</b><br/>
            While this sonnet is focused on love, its tone<br/>
            and sentiments are deeply personal, revealing<br/>
            both the intensity and strength of the poet's <br/>
            emotions-qualities often associated with<br/>
            women, particularly in the context of Victorian<br/>
            expectations of women's emotional depth and<br/>
            devotion.
